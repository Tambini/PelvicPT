      <h1 className="question">What is pelvic floor physical therapy?</h1>
      <p className="answer">
        Pelvic floor physical therapy is a specialized branch of physical
        therapy that focuses on the structures surrounding your pelvis, abdomen
        and spine. This area can often be a driver in pain, bowel/bladder issues
        and sexual dysfunction.
      </p>
      <h1 className="question">What can I expect in my first session? </h1>
      <p className="answer">
        You will meet one on one with the physical therapist discussing your
        concerns in depth. There is a comprehensive subjective exam where you
        may choose to disclose your health history and anything that may be
        related to your diagnosis. Following a history, your physical therapist
        will perform a general musculoskeletal assessment including posture and
        movement screen, gait analysis, manual muscle testing, range of motion
        and special testing. In addition, with your consent, the therapist may
        perform a pelvic floor examination. This includes assessing the muscles
        of your pelvis externally and internally via your vaginal and/or rectal
        canal. You may opt to defer the internal exam, however it provides very
        valuable information and assists in a timely recovery.
      </p>
      <h1 className="question">How long are the visits? </h1>
      <p className="answer">
        We offer 60 minute treatment sessions working 1:1 with your physical
        therapist.
      </p>
      <h1 className="question"> Do you take insurance? </h1>
      <p className="answer">
        I have decided to not participate with insurance companies. This allows
        me to offer private one hour sessions specifically tailored to your
        needs. I provide superbills at every session, which you may choose to
        submit to your insurance company. If you have out of network benefits,
        this is often reimbursed. You may contact your insurance company for
        additional information.
      </p>
      <h1 className="question">Do you have a cancelation policy? </h1>
      <p className="answer">
        We understand that things can come up last minute. However, we ask you
        provide 24 hour notice for a missed appointment. Cancelation within this
        window will result in a $75.00 charge.
      </p>
      <h1 className="question">Do I need a prescription?</h1>
      <p className="answer">
        Physical therapists have direct access in the state of NJ, so you do not
        need a prescription to attend pelvic floor PT. However, some insurances
        may require a prescription to reimburse for services. Also, if your
        physical therapist believes you may need further medical attention in
        addition to physical therapy services, you may be referred to a medical
        provider. 
      </p>
      <h1 className="question">What should I wear to my appointment? </h1>
      <p className="answer">
        Please wear something that you feel comfortable moving around in,
        similar to what you would wear to exercise.
